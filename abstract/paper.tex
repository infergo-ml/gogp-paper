\begin{abstract}
We present a view on practical probabilistic programming, as
well as an inference facility for Go programs following the
view. Probabilistic programming promises to free the
practitioner from burden of re-implementing inference paradigms
and algorithms. There are dozens of probabilistic programming
languages currently in development. Yet, integrating
probabilistic programming inference into a software system
requires greater effort than writing a custom simulation and
inference algorithm. Probabilistic programming remains, at best,
a tool for modeling and prototyping.

We believe that the probabilistic programming approach can be
made practical. However, this requires a shift from design of
languages best suited for probabilistic inference to design of
tools and libraries which make probabilistic programming in
modern general-purpose languages accessible and convenient.
Here, we first discuss the challenges in practical use of
existing probabilistic programming systems, and then outline the
guidelines to implementation of a practical probabilistic
programming facility. We illustrate these guidelines on an
early-stage implementation of probabilistic programming facility
for the Go programming language.
