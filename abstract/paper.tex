# Towards practical probabilistic programming

We present our view on practical probabilistic programming, as
well as an inference facility for Go programs following the
view. Probabilistic programming promises to free the
practitioner from burden of re-implementing inference paradigms
and algorithms. There are dozens of probabilistic programming
languages currently in development. Yet, integrating
probabilistic programming inference into a software system
requires greater effort than writing a custom simulation and
inference algorithm. Probabilistic programming remains, at best,
a tool for modeling and prototyping.

We believe that the probabilistic programming approach can be
made practical. However, this requires a shift from design of
languages best suited for probabilistic inference to design
of tools and libraries which make probabilistic programming
in modern general-purpose languages accessible and convenient.
